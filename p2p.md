## Pre-History
https://datapath.io/resources/blog/the-history-of-border-gateway-protocol/
* ARPANet 1969 ( or 1971 )
* USENET, 1979 -  Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
* Gateway-to-gateway protocol (GGP) 1982  - its only focus was routing based on the number of AS hops. GGP focused on routing internet transit the fewest number of autonomous system (AS) hops to a destination.
* 1984
  - FidoNet
  - Exterior gateway protocol (originally discussed in 1982) a tree-like distance-vector internet routing protocol.
  - Cisco Systems founded
* 1985 - The National Science Foundation begins to support advanced research and education in networking.
* Between the developments of Usenet in 1979 to the 1990â€™s, files sharing were primarily done through the use of bulletin board based systems.
* 1986 - The first super computers are connected to the internet. The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) initiated TCP/IP connections and operations. This becomes the first form of the internet backbone.

The events through the 1980s expose the need for an all-encompassing internet routing protocol. This is exactly when BGP is developed. On three sheets of paper.

* 1988 - Internet routing (BGP) -RFC 1058. This is the oldest distance-vector routing protocol in its modern context. This begins to lay the groundwork for BGP.
* August 1989 - Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

### 1st Gen - Centralized

* [June 1, 1999, Napster](https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-napster-2438592)
  > Napster had a very different face when it first came into existence in 1999. The developers of the original Napster (brothers Shawn and John Fanning, along with Sean Parker) launched the service as a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing network. The software application was easy to use with a free account, and it was specifically designed for sharing digital music files (in the MP3 format) across a Web-connected network.

### 2nd Gen - Decentralized

* 1999 [Freenet](http://freenetproject.org/)	
* 2000 - [Gnutella](http://rakjar.de/gnufu/index.php/Main_Page)
* 2002 eMule (uses edonkey servers and has its own decentralized network)
  > [What is eMule?](https://www.emule-project.net/home/perl/general.cgi?l=1)
  > At dawn of  May 13th 2002 a guy called Merkur was dissatisfied with the original eDonkey2000 client and was convinced he could do better. So he did. He gathered other developers around him, and eMule Project was born. Their aim was to put the client back on track where eDonkey had been famous before, adding tons of new features and a nice GUI. They couldn't imagine what impact this decision would have...

## Extra

* https://wiki.debian.org/eDonkey
  >* aMule -aMule is a peer to peer file sharing application that works with the eDonkey computer network, but offers more features than the standard eDonkey client. It is based on the eMule sourcecode, and evolved from ?LMule and xMule. It is now the Linux client on the eMule links section on their webpage. As eMule, aMule is open source software released under the GNU ?GeneralPublicLicense.
