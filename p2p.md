## Pre-History
https://datapath.io/resources/blog/the-history-of-border-gateway-protocol/
* ARPANet 1969 ( or 1971 )
* USENET, 1979 -  Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
* Gateway-to-gateway protocol (GGP) 1982  - its only focus was routing based on the number of AS hops. GGP focused on routing internet transit the fewest number of autonomous system (AS) hops to a destination.
* 1984
  - FidoNet
  - Exterior gateway protocol (originally discussed in 1982) a tree-like distance-vector internet routing protocol.
  - Cisco Systems founded
* 1985 - The National Science Foundation begins to support advanced research and education in networking.
* Between the developments of Usenet in 1979 to the 1990â€™s, files sharing were primarily done through the use of bulletin board based systems.
* 1986 - The first super computers are connected to the internet. The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) initiated TCP/IP connections and operations. This becomes the first form of the internet backbone.

The events through the 1980s expose the need for an all-encompassing internet routing protocol. This is exactly when BGP is developed. On three sheets of paper.

* 1988 - Internet routing (BGP) -RFC 1058. This is the oldest distance-vector routing protocol in its modern context. This begins to lay the groundwork for BGP.
* August 1989 - Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
